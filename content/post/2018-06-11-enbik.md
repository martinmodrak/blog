For the Czech national bioinformatics conference ([ENBIK](http://www.enbik.cz)) I prepared a short presentation on Type S and Type M errors and how to use simulations to understand what your method might do before conducting an experiment.

I show how t-test can fail, inspired by [Andrew Gelman's take on power = .06](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/11/17/power-06-looks-like-get-used/) and how DESeq2 (used to determine differentially expressed genes) does a good job at mitigating false positives at the cost of increased false negatives.

[The slides are here](/post/2018-06-11-enbik/enbik.html) or check the [GitHub repo with simulation code](https://github.com/cas-bioinf/statistical-simulations).
