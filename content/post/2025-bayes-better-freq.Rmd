I am not a staunch advocate of Bayesian methods --- I can totally see how for some
questions a frequentist approach may provide more satisfactory answers.
In this post, we'll explore how for a simple scenario (negative binomial regression with small sample size),
standard frequentist methods fail at being frequentist while standard Bayesian methods provide good frequentist guarantees.

## A bit of theory

First, lets make sure we all agree what we are talking about. 
Those comfortable with Bayesian and frequentist calibration may safely skip to the next section.

For simplicity, we will focus on uncertainty intervals for a continuous parameter. 
A frequentist will construct a [_confidence interval_]{.highlight1} (CI) which should satisfy the following requirement:

> For [any fixed]{.highlight1} parameter value, $x\%$ CI contains the true value [at least]{.highlight2} $x\%$ of the time.

In other words, we are aiming to control [_worst case_]{.highlight2} behaviour.
We also note that CIs do not require exact coverage, but put a lower bound on coverage --- this is
primarily because in many settings a CI with exact coverage may not exist 
(i.e. to obtain sufficient coverage in the worst case, one must settle for larger than nominal coverage elsewhere).
CIs are closely related to frequentist tests as any hypothesis outside of $1 - \alpha$ CI can be rejected at $\alpha$ level.

A Bayesian will typically compute a [_credible interval_]{.highlight1} (CrI), which has a slightly different property:

> [Averaged]{.highlight1} over the prior, $x\%$ CrI contains the true value [exactly]{.highlight2} $x\%$ of the time.

So instead of worst case we are looking at the average case. We explicitly accept that specific parameter values may lead to low coverage 
as long as other parameter values lead to higher coverage.
On the other hand, we are often able to compute exact^[or precise enough, with MCMC] credible intervals achieveng precisely the
desired coverage.

To highlight the difference, we will use a simple "coin flipping" scenario:

$$
Y \sim \text{Binomial}(20, \theta)
$$

And assume a Bayesian would use a uniform prior:

$$
\theta \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)
$$

In this setting, we can do reliable frequentist inference with the [Clopper-Pearson interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper%E2%80%93Pearson_interval) or
obtain  a Bayesian posterior via the Beta distribution $\pi(\theta | Y = y) = \text{Beta}(y + 1, 20 - y + 1)$.

Let's look on the coverage of the Clopper-Pearson interval as well as a credible interval, specifically the 95% highest 
posterior density interval^[In many cases the central CrI will work well, but here it has unnecessary problems as even when we have all
success or all failures, the central posterior interval does not include 0 or 1, but the highest posterior density interval does.] for
all possible values of $\theta$:

```{r binomial-coverage, echo=FALSE}
clopper_pearson_ci_fun <- function(N, N_success, alpha = 0.05) {
  list(
    low = qbeta(alpha / 2, N_success, N - N_success + 1),
    high = qbeta(1 - alpha / 2, N_success + 1, N - N_success)
  )
}

bayesian_uniform_hpdi_fun <- function(N, N_success, alpha = 0.05) {
  low <- numeric(length(N_success))
  high <- numeric(length(N_success))
  for(i in seq_along(N_success)) {
    if(N_success[i] == 0) {
      low[i] <- 0
      high[i] <- qbeta(1 - alpha, N_success[i] + 1, N - N_success[i] + 1)
    } else if(N_success[i] == N) {
      low[i] <- qbeta(alpha, N_success[i] + 1, N - N_success[i] + 1)
      high[i] <- 1
    } else {
      hdi_ <- HDInterval::hdi(qbeta, shape1 = N_success[i] + 1, shape2 = N - N_success[i] + 1)
      low[i] <- hdi_[1]
      high[i] <- hdi_[2]
    }
  }
  list(low = low, high = high)
}

coverage_single <- function(N, proportion, ci, alpha = 0.05) {
  weights <- dbinom(0:N, size = N, prob = proportion)
  coverage_all <- ci$low <= proportion & ci$high >= proportion
  
  sum(weights * coverage_all)
}

coverage_df <- function(N, props_to_test, ci_fun, label, alpha = 0.05) {
  ci <- ci_fun(N, 0:N, alpha = alpha)
  
  data.frame(
    N = N,
    props_to_test = props_to_test,
    label = label,
    coverage = purrr::map_dbl(props_to_test, .f = \(x) coverage_single(N = N_to_test, proportion = x, ci = ci))
  )
}

props_to_test <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.001)
N_to_test <- 20

coverage_df_bayesian_hdpi <- 
  coverage_df(N_to_test, props_to_test, label = "Bayesian HPDI\n(uniform prior)", ci_fun = bayesian_uniform_hpdi_fun)

coverage_df_cp <- 
  coverage_df(N_to_test, props_to_test, label = "Clopper-Pearson", ci_fun = clopper_pearson_ci_fun)

coverage_for_plot <- rbind(
  coverage_df_bayesian_hdpi,
  coverage_df_cp
)

coverage_plot <- function(coverage_for_plot) {
  coverage_for_plot |> ggplot() + aes(x = props_to_test, y = coverage) +
    geom_hline(color = "orangered", yintercept = 0.95) + 
    geom_line() + 
    facet_wrap(~label) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0.9, 1)) +
    scale_x_continuous("True proportion (Î¸)")
  
}

coverage_plot(coverage_for_plot)
```

We see that the Clopper-Pearson interval is conservative: it always achieves at least 95% coverage (sometimes much larger),
regardless of the true proportion ($\theta$). OTOH, the Bayesian HPDI has higher coverage for some values and lower for others
--- in fact the area above the red horizontal line (nominal calibration) is exactly equal to the area under and thus we have
exactly 95% coverage when averaged over uniform prior. The Clopper-Pearson intervals would naturally be a bit wider than the Bayesian HPDI. 
We also see that discrete data make the plot look pretty wild.

## The curious case of the negative binomial

To show a situation where standard frequentist intervals don't perform so well, we are going to fit a negative binomial regression model, with 2 groups.
Technically:

$$
y_i \sim NB(\mu_i, \phi) \\
\log\mu_i = \alpha + \beta \times \text{group}_i
$$

where $\text{group}_i$ is a binary indicator of group membership.
For the frequentist side, we will be using `MASS` package:

```r
MASS::glm.nb(y ~ group, data = data)
```

as well as the `gamlss` package:

```r
gamlss::gamlss(y ~ group, family = "NBI")
```

and the `glmmTMB` package:


```r
glmmTMB::glmmTMB(y ~ group, family = glmmTMB::nbinom2, data = data)
```

on the Bayesian side, we'll use the `brms` package with flat priors:

```r
brms::brm(y ~ group, data = data, family = "negbinomial", 
  prior = brms::prior("", class = "Intercept"))
```

(the results don't change much if we keep the default prior).

Note that frequentist coverage needs to hold for [any]{.highlight1} true parameter
value, so proving a frequentist method works is hard, but finding even a single set of parameters where the coverage does not hold
invalidates the method (strictly speaking).

We will focus on a small-sample scenario with 4 observations in each group. 
As a check, we will also include large-sample scenario with 100 observations in each group.

To cover a range of somewhat realistic scenarios, we will use a single value of $\alpha = \log(100)$,
and iterate over 10 values of $\beta$ equally spaced between $0$ and $2$ and $\phi \in \{0.5, 1, 2.5, 10\}$.

Typically $\beta$ is the parameter of interest, so we will examine its coverage
and we won't care about the coverage for $\alpha$ and $\phi$ as that's tangential (and packages rarely optimize for those parameters).

Here is our simulation code (note that we make sure to always use exactly the same
dataset with all packages):

```{r simulation}
sim_nb_coverage_single <- function(N_per_group, mu, b, phi, sim_id, base_brm) {
  group <- c(rep(0, N_per_group), rep(1, N_per_group))
  
  y <- rnbinom(2 * N_per_group, mu = exp(mu + b * group), size = phi)
  data <- data.frame(y, group)
  
  cf_glm.nb <- suppressMessages(confint(MASS::glm.nb(y ~ group, data = data))[2, ])
  
  cf_gamlss <- tryCatch({
    fit_gamlss <- gamlss::gamlss(y ~ group, family = "NBI", data = data)
    confint(fit_gamlss)[2, ]
  }, error = function(e) {
    return(c(NA, NA))
  })
  
  
  cf_glmmTMB <- tryCatch({
    m <- glmmTMB::glmmTMB(y ~ group, family = glmmTMB::nbinom2, data = data)
    confint(m,
            method = "profile",
            parm = "group",
            estimate = FALSE)
  }, error = function(e) {
    return(c(NA, NA))
  })
  
  
  # Rarely we get problematic init which results in fitted phi -> infty and bad BFMI
  # refitting fixes that (more informative prior on phi also would)
  for (i in 1:5) {
    fit_brm <- update(
      base_brm,
      newdata = data,
      cores = 1,
      chains = 2,
      future = FALSE,
      refresh = 0
    )
    
    if (all(!is.na(rstan::get_bfmi(fit_brm$fit)))) {
      break
    }
  }
  
  bfmi_problem <- any(is.na(rstan::get_bfmi(fit_brm$fit)))
  cf_brm <- brms::fixef(fit_brm)["group", c(3, 4)]
  
  data.frame(
    method = c("glm.nb", "glmmTMB", "gamlss", "brms"),
    sim_id,
    mu = mu,
    b = b,
    phi = phi,
    N_per_group = N_per_group,
    ci_low = unname(c(
      cf_glm.nb[1], cf_glmmTMB[1], cf_gamlss[1], cf_brm[1]
    )),
    ci_high = unname(c(
      cf_glm.nb[2], cf_glmmTMB[2], cf_gamlss[2], cf_brm[2]
    )),
    bfmi_problem = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, bfmi_problem)
  )
}
```


Now we just run it (+cache results)

```{r run-sims}
coverage_cache_file <- file.path(cache_dir, "nb_coverage.rds")
if(!file.exists(coverage_cache_file)) {
  
  
  # Construct base brms object to update
  mu_0 <- log(100)
  group_eff <- log(1.5)
  true_phi <- 2.5
  group <- c(rep(0, 4), rep(1, 4))
  y <- rnbinom(8, mu = exp(mu_0 + group_eff * group), size = true_phi)
  prior <- c(brms::prior("", class = "Intercept"))
  base_brm <- brms::brm(
    y ~ group,
    data = data.frame(y, group),
    family = "negbinomial",
    prior = prior,
    backend = "cmdstanr"
  )
  
  
  scenarios <- tidyr::crossing(
    N_per_group = c(4, 100),
    mu = log(100),
    b = seq(0, 2, length.out = 10),
    phi = c(0.5, 1, 2.5, 10),
    sim_id = 1:1000
  )
  
  
  nb_coverage_df <- furrr::future_pmap_dfr(
    scenarios,
    \(...) sim_nb_coverage_single(..., base_brm = base_brm),
    .options = furrr::furrr_options(seed = TRUE, chunk_size = 40)
  )
  
  saveRDS(nb_coverage_df, file = coverage_cache_file)
} else {
  nb_coverage_df <- readRDS(coverage_cache_file)
}
```



And we plot the results for $4$ observations per group --- showing the coverage + dark gray band is the the remaining
uncertainty about the coverage (via the Clopper-Pearson interval):

```{r plot-nb-sims}


coverage_plot <- function(coverage_df) {
  coverage_df |>
    filter(!is.na(ci_low), !is.na(ci_high)) |>
    mutate(
      covered = b >= ci_low & b <= ci_high,
      `Ï` = phi,
      method = factor(method, levels = c("brms", "glmmTMB", "gamlss", "glm.nb"))
    ) |>
    group_by(method, b, phi, `Ï`) |>
    summarise(
      coverage = mean(covered),
      n_covered = sum(covered),
      coverage_low = qbeta(0.025, n_covered, n() - n_covered + 1),
      coverage_high = qbeta(0.975, n_covered + 1 , n() - n_covered),
      .groups = "drop"
    ) |>
    ggplot()  + aes(
      x = b,
      ymin = coverage_low,
      y = coverage,
      ymax = coverage_high
    ) +
    geom_hline(color = "orangered", yintercept = 0.95) +
    geom_ribbon(fill = "#888", alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_line() + facet_grid(`Ï` ~ method, labeller = "label_both") +
    scale_y_continuous("Coverage", labels = scales::percent) +
    scale_x_continuous("True Î²") + theme(strip.text.y = element_text(size = 10))
}

nb_coverage_df |> filter(N_per_group == 4) |> coverage_plot()
```

We see that `glm.nb` performs pretty badly with coverage of the 95% CI fluctuating between ~75% and ~90%. 
The `gamlss` intervals are only slightly better and `glmmTMB` is yet better but still staying close to 90% coverage for all settings.
In other words, all of the frequentist intervals are too narrow.
On the other hand `brms` provides very close to nominal frequentist coverage for all tested parameter values, 
despite not technically claiming that guarantee.
So what did happen to the frequentist packages?

## Frequentist computation is HARD

There is a dirty secret behind most commonly used frequentist methods --- except for a 
few special cases (e.g., standard linear regression, the aforementioned Clopper-Pearson interval) they are only
only approximations that are justified by their behaviour in the large-data limit, but which
have no strict guarantees in small datasets. Actual honest small-sample-guaranteed frequentist computation is hard for non-trivial models
and often requires solutions specific to a single class of models.

The two most-commonly found approximations are:

1. [Normal]{.highlight1} (also sometimes called "[Wald]{.highlight1}") - this relies on the normal approximation to the likelihood around the maximum-likelihood estimate, usually
also accounting for additional uncertainty due to a scale parameter being estimated by using a Student's t-distribution with appropriate number of degrees of freedom. In our example, `gamlss` derives CIs via the t distribution.
2. [Profile likelihood]{.highlight2} CIs which are derived from the $\chi^2$ approximation in the [likelihood-ratio test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test) (i.e. any value that wouldn't be rejected by a likelihood ratio test at $5\%$ is included in the $95\%$ CI).
In our example both `glm.nb` and `glmmTMB` compute profile confidence intervals (`glmmTMB` computes Wald intervals by default, but we have set `method = "profile"` to get profile intervals as `gamlss` already gave us Wald intervals).

It is generally agreed that profile confidence intervals typically have better performance in small samples, i.e. they approach the asymptotic regime faster than normal/Wald intervals.

The reason why `glm.nb` performs worse than `gamlss` and `glmmTMB` is that `glm.nb` is a wrapper around `glm` 
which for technical reasons^[Because it delegates most of its work to `glm` which requires an exponential family distribution. Neg. binomial with fixed $\phi$ is exponential family but with $\phi$ unknown it is not. `glm.nb` iteratively lets `glm` optimize all paramters except $\phi$ and then optimized $\phi$ and then refits via `glm` until convergence. But all methods on the fit (`confint`, `predict`, ...) are delegated to `glm` which then keeps $\phi$ at the ML estimate.] treats $\phi$ as constant instead of optimizing it in the profile computation (as `glmmTMB` does), i.e.
any uncertainty in $\phi$ is ignored when computing the CIs in `glm.nb`. 

`gamlss` takes into account the uncertainty in $\phi$ but uses a Wald interval, which (as expected) performs worse than the profile likelihood used in `glmmTMB`.

Since the packages included exhaust the common, general approaches to compute CIs, there is not
much hope to get better coverage with another frequentist package, unless it implements
some specialized method tailored specifically to negative binomial models.

On the contrary, `brms` uses MCMC and allows for "exact" (Bayesian) computation
regardless of sample size. It turns out that in this example, exact Bayesian answer is
much closer to a correct frequentist answer than approximate frequentist approaches.

## Large data limit

As a check we show that as we increase the sample size to 100 per group, we see all
packages to converge on nominal coverage (as in large sample limit all of the approaches are equivalent).

```{r plot-large-data}
nb_coverage_df |> filter(N_per_group == 100) |> coverage_plot()
```

Note that the scale of the vertical axis has shrunk substantially and all the remaining
coverages are within 92% - 96%.

In fact we can see that the
95% CI bounds for all methods are basically identical when we have 100 observations per group --- in the table below we focus on 
the distance between median of the lower/upper bound of all methods. The only slight difference is to `brms` where we hit the limits
of precision of the MCMC chains we ran, but except a few outliers (due to bad initialization, which could be resolved by even mild priors or just rerunning the chain) the bounds are within 0.01 of the other methods.

```{r}
ci_match_summary <- function(coverage_df) {
  coverage_df |>
    group_by(sim_id, N_per_group, mu, b, phi) |>
    mutate(low = ci_low - median(ci_low),
           high = ci_high - median(ci_high)) |>
    pivot_longer(all_of(c("low", "high")), names_to = "bound", values_to = "value") |>
    group_by(method, bound) |>
    summarise(
      `Within 0.01` = sum(abs(value) < 0.01),
      `Outside 0.01` = sum(abs(value) >= 0.01),
      `Outside 0.1` = sum(abs(value) >= 0.1),
      .groups = "drop"
    )
}
nb_coverage_df |> filter(N_per_group == 100) |> ci_match_summary() |> knitr::kable()
```



## Conclusions

The aim of this demonstration is an existential proof: there are practically relevant cases where
fitting a Bayesian model with flat (or very wide) priors gives you better frequentist performance than
common frequentist approaches.

I stumbled on this pretty randomly and I am not sure how common such situations are, but if anybody insists
that frequentist tools are for some reason inherently superior to Bayesian, remember: most commonly used
frequentist methods are approximations without strong small-sample guarantees. In such settings, even
a staunch frequentist may be better served by Bayesian computation.
