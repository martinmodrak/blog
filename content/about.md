This is a personal webpage/plog of Martin Modr√°k, an academic researcher in bioinformatics, currently at [Institute of Microbiology](http://www.mbucas.cz) of the Czech Academy of Sciences, [laboratory of bioinformatics](http://lab126.mbu.cas.cz).

I also used to do research in AI for computer games. And I have a defunct [software engineering blog](http://babickababa.blogspot.cz).
