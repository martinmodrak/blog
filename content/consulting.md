I love thinking about other people's statistical problems! So [get in touch](mailto:modrak.mar@gmail.com) if you need help with:

 * Developing and debugging statistical models (particularly Stan and INLA)
 * Exploratory data analysis
 * Statistical graphics

## Small Inquiries

If I have time, I will answer to small inquiries on [Stan Discourse](https://discourse.mc-stan.org). You can check out [list of my previous answers](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/u/martinmodrak/activity).

## Academic Research

I am privileged to have a lot of freedom in what I do in research. So within the academic sphere, I am generally open to more substantial consulting in exchange for co-authorship, details depend on the project. You can check out my published research output on [my ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8886-7797), some not officialy published stuff is also at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?q=%2BMartin%20%2BModr%C3%A1k).

## Commercial / NGO

Commercial and NGO consulting is available on a case-by-case basis, though I have less experience in this area. Currently, I am helping the [Czech Scout Movement](https://www.skaut.cz/) use insights from data to better harness and grow the potential of its young adult members.
